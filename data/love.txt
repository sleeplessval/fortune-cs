PLYADES		I'll take care of you.\nORESTES		It's rotten work.\nPLYADES		Not to me. Not if it's you.\n\n	- Anne Carson, Euripides
me: good night darling. I'm so happy to be able to fall asleep\nnext to you\n\nmy gf: *already rotating like a kebab  to ensure maximum duvet\ntheft*\n\n	- @davideastUK@twitter.com
<sawasawako>\nidc anymore i think we should be a burden to each other\n\nand yes this includes a certain degree of tolerance for emotional\nburden, all else being equal. my love for you, and loyalty to\nyou, is not dependent on how easy you make it for me to love you.\ni don't value you for how little trouble you cause me. i want to\nlearn how to take you for who you are, instead of who i want you\nto be or who i think you should be\n\n<starrbear>\nThe measure of any relationship should not be whether loving\nsomeone is work, but whether it is work that you are glad to do.\n\n	- tumblr exchange
I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,\nthe sovereign nose of your arrogant face,\nI want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,\n	- Pablo Neruda
