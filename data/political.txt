the distortion of "there is potential profit we did not earn" as\n"there is money we lost" is fascinating and disgusting to me.\n"megamediacongolmerate lost $1,000,000,000 to piracy this year"\nis a flat out lie. it is not true. they did not have a billion\ndollars, that they now do not have. they felt entitled to one\nbillion dollars, that they did not have, and still do not have.\nit's an infuriating perversion of the truth.\n\n	- strawberry-bundae, tumblr post
I'm tired of being the butt of everyone's jokes.\nI'm tired of being talked about like I'm not here.\nI'm tired of being a political token. Tired of being under\nscrutiny for no reason. Tired of being presumed guilty until\nproven innocent. Tired of being used as a cudgel to put down\nother trans people. I'm tired of having to constantly be on my\nbest behavior lest someone decide to ruin my life over some\ninsignificant slight. And I'm tired, most of all, because the\npeople who do all this stuff also surround themselves with legions\nof sycophants who'll constantly jerk them off about how good and\nwoke and progressive they are and about how the big scary\nhysterical ****** is just being mean for no reason.\n\nI'm tired. I just wanna play video games and read books about\nelves. I didn't sign up for whatever the fuck this is.\n\n	- natalieironside, tumblr post.
"The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the\ndance hall, the public-house; the less you think, love, theorize, paint, sing,\nfence, etc., the more you save—the greater becomes your treasure which neither\nmoths nor dust will devour—your capital. The less you are, the more you have;\nthe less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life—the\ngreater is the store of your estranged being."\n\n	- Karl Marx, Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts or 1844
