1.1 INTRODUCTION: THERMODYNAMICS AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF\n    THE PERFECT GAS\n\n	Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying\nstatistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul\nEhrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it\nis our turn to study statistical mechanics.\n\n	- David L. Goodstein, States of Matter
