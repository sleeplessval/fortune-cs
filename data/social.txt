An ant crosses your carpet. A spider weaves a pattern older than mammals beneath your stairs. Just nod, breathe, and think, "Good. It's all still here. The forest, the mountains, the desert. At home in my home." The sterile white box is the stranger. Not the ant. Not the spider.\n\n	- @CryptoNature@twitter.com, 2018-27-08
